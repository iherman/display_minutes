# Tool to display an overview for the W3C WG/IG minutes

The goal is to

- give an overview of all minutes of a specific group
- give an overview of the resolutions of a specific group
- (optionally) exchange IRC nicknames with real names (if the mapping is available)

The current repository keeps the (relevant) structure of an example deployment; all files in the `minutes` directory are meant as an example only. The `minutes/index.html` and `minutes/resolutions.html` files are generated by the present script and manually moved there. The only part of the repository that should be transferred for deployment are the `script` directory.
